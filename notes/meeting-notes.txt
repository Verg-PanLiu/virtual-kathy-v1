Virtual Kathy: A conversational agent for the CS Department.
This project will create a conversational agent (chatbot) to handle questions submitted to the CS department front office (e.g., where can I find Dr. X, do I need TOEFL for graduate studies, what is the admission process for the BS degree, is Y course offered, who do I contact for advice, etc). The project entails:
- creating training questions (by crowdsourcing them), 
- creating matching answers (some static / some through a database),
- setting up the conversational agent, 
- supporting "context" (i.e., follow-up questions), 
- routing non-answerable questions to humans,
- testing the chatbot, and
- submitting the new questions and answers to step one to improve the system.

The capstone project will benefit from experience with NLP/chatbots/databases, but not required (i.e., you will need to pick it up).
Target group size = 4-5 students

NLP = black box
