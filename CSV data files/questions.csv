See the Catalog for details."
test scores,36,How do I determine which is required?,,"GRE: How the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is used as part of the admissions process varies by program within SCI. Please see individual program requirements (as indexed in the table below) for details. GRE scores are valid for five years.

Required English Testing: If your native language is not English, then you must submit either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) or Duolingo English Test. All non-native English speakers need to submit scores from one of these tests that meets the minimum score required by departments/programs.  Minimum scores are indexed by program in this table. Applicants with scores below the minimum will be ineligible for admission to the intended SCI graduate program, regardless of the academic strength and fit of the rest of the application.

The Duolingo English Test is an online English proficiency test that can be taken online, on demand, in under an hour. The test is taken online via a computer with a webcam and microphone. The test includes a proficiency score, video interview, and writing sample. Certified results are available within 48 hours of the test session, and test results are considered an acceptable alternative to TOEFL or IELTS by the School of Computing and Information."
test scores,37,How do I provide my test scores to SCI?,,"All test scores (TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo English Test and/or GRE/GMAT) must be uploaded (as a full page PDF) to your application. If the scores are not uploaded by the time you apply, you will have to send test results in PDF format to our admissions team at sciadmit@pitt.edu and your application will not be considered complete until you send test scores to the school. 

You should request the test agencies to send us official scores when you apply. Electronic TOEFL and GRE scores must be submitted by ETS, Duolingo English Test score must be submitted by Duolingo, and printed official report of IELTS and GMAT should be sent to the School of Computing and Information. Failure to submit your official scores will result in an inability to register for classes in your first semester."

education,54,Where do I mail my transcripts?,,"No paper copies of your transcript are necessary at the time you apply.

If you upload a transcript from a foreign country, you must include an English translation. Note: this must be a copy of an official transcript from the university. (Uploading a personally made PDF of your courses and grades will NOT be accepted.)

If you cannot upload transcript due to technical glitch, you may send your official transcripts to:

SCI Record Office

education,55,Do I have to submit an International Transcript Evaluation?,,"All degrees obtained outside of the U.S. will be evaluated for equivalency to U.S. educational standards by the School of Computing and Information/University of Pittsburgh. Therefore, all international applicants must provide an official English-language translation of all pertinent transcripts. In a small number of cases, the Admissions Committee may be unfamiliar with the university from which you graduated. In such cases, the committee reserves the right to request an external review of your transcript, the cost of which is the responsibility of the applicant."
